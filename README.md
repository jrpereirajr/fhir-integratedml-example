# fhir-intergratedml-example
An example on how to use InterSystems IRIS for Health FHIR database to perform ML models througth InterSystems IRIS IntegratedML

## Description
IntegratedML is a great feature for train/test and deploy ML models. FHIR is a powerful standard for health information interoperability. This project aims to show how to use IRIS/IRIS for Health tools, like DTL transformations to prepare FHIR data for applying ML models in IntegratedML.
Some potential applications for ideas presented in this project:
 - Reuse/extend DTL transformations in other FHIR databases for custom ML models
 - Use DTL transformations for normalize FHIR messages and publish ML models as services
